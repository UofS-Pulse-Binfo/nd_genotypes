ND Genotype: Available Documentation
====================================

This module provides support and visualization of genotypic data stored in a modified GMOD Chado schema. The 3.x branch of this module represents a shift towards support for large scale genotypic datasets through backwards compatible improvements to the Chado schema including a new gathering table for genotypes (genotype_call) modelled after the chado phenotype table, optimized queries and well-choosen indexes.

.. note::
  Easy Data loading is available via the `Genotypes Loader <https://github.com/UofS-Pulse-Binfo/genotypes_loader>`_ which supports VCF files!
