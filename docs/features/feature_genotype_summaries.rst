Marker/Variant Genotype Summary Fields
======================================

This field adds a summary pie chart figure to marker or variant pages. It shows the ratio of alleles saved for the given marker/variant and can be used to give the researcher an idea of what alleles to expect when using the marker, as well as, how rare a given result might be.
